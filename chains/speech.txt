Good morning everyone,

Today, I want to talk about the importance of education. Education is not just about textbooks and exams; it’s about the power to think critically, to question the world around us, and to shape our future.

Education opens doors to opportunities that were once thought to be unreachable. It empowers individuals, uplifts communities, and drives progress in every field of life.

As we move forward in an ever-changing world, it is essential that we continue to invest in learning—not just in schools, but throughout our lives. Lifelong education is the key to adapting, growing, and contributing meaningfully to society.

Let us remember: education is not a privilege, it is a right. And with that right comes the responsibility to use it wisely—for ourselves and for the generations to come.

Thank you.
